# AnalyticalProjects
A series of jupyter notebooks and associated data files to help chemistry students learn to use python for solving analytical chemistry problems. These notebooks were first used in the Fall, 2018 Analyical Chemistry course (CHEM 115) at UC Merced. Completed notebooks with solutions for instructors can be requested by emailing Prof. Erik Menke at emenke@ucmerced.edu.
